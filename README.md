AE 588 Final Project: Comparison of OpenMDAO and AeroSandBox for Trajectory Optimization

## File Structure
- AeroSandbox directory: test cases run with ASB
- dymos directory: test cases run with Dymos
- references directory: papers referenced for project

## Note on dependencies
AeroSandbox and Dymos dependencies conflict, so individual requirements.txt files are in each folder that contain the necessary dependencies for each. Recommend creating a virtual environment for AeroSandbox and separate conda environment for Dymos.
